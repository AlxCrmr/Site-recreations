                            <p>Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. There's one way and only

                                everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.</p>
                            <p>I'm a thing. Take me to your leader! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will
                                hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.</p>
                            <p>This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't
                                just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel
                                angry! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.</p>
                            <p>Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. I
                                videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them
                                later. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
